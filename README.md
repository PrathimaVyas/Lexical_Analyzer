# Lexical_Analyzer

**Abstract:**

Lexcial Analyzer is the process of converting a sequence of characters into a sequence of tokens. A program or function which performs lexcial analysis is called a Lexical Analyzer. This is designed to recognize keywords, operators, integers, functions, header files and preprocessor directories.

**Requirements:**
1. It should identify all the keywords
2. It should identify all the identifiers
3. It should identify the literals, such as float, characters, string literals, decimals
4. It should identify the functions
5. At last it should display the tokenized output.

For example:

     sum = 3;

   sum -> identifier
   
   = -> operator

   3 ->  integer constant
   
   ; -> end of the statement

**Pre-requisite:**
1. File I/O Operations
2. File Pointers
3. String Operations
