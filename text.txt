Weâ€™ll make a Lexical Analyzer in C, or a C program that detects tokens in a C program.
Lexical Analysis sometimes referred to as a scanner, is the initial phase of the compiler.
It delivers the input program to the syntax analyzer after converting it into a series of Tokens.
The simplest unit of code is the token, which can be a Keyword, Identifier, Constant, String Literal, or Symbol.
